I hope to update the repo on weekends. 

## How you can contribute

If you would like any metrics to be added, please let me know. I would be happy to mention your name alongside the metric as the contributor. 

You can reach out to me here or via the Google Sheets page. 

## A couple of notes

1. There is always the possibility that the metric is named or described differently from the original source. I may have done it to make the meaning or description clearer. But I have tried to keep the intent of the metric close to the original.
